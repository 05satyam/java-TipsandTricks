## binary tree  
https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/binary-tree-data-structure/

traversal:  
```
level order (using recursion, iterative, my way) -Imp
inorder -Imp
preorder -Imp
postorder -Imp

zigzag
boundry 
left view
right view
botton view
top view
```

operation:  
```
depth of tree -Imp

count level wise nodes
mirror
diameter
find depth
find height

```

## binary search tree  
```
insertion

deletion

**heap**  
* Heap a is always complete binary tree.  
* we only insert node at the bottom and then heapify the tree.  
* we only delete the node from top and inset the last node at the place of deleted node and heapify.
